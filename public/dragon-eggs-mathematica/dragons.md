Look at the readme to understand the format of the story objects. Here are my narrative instructions:

Base story name (change it to something better): Charlie's Dragon Quest: The Stolen Eggs of Mathematica

**Title**
- Answer: The Dragon Eggs of Mathematica

**1. What's the main setting? Where does your story take place?** (A magical kingdom, space station, underwater city, haunted mansion, modern school, ancient temple, etc.)
- Answer: The Kingdom of Mathematica - a magical realm where numbers and equations float in the air, geometric shapes form the architecture, and mathematical concepts come to life. Ancient libraries filled with formula scrolls, crystal caves with numerical patterns, and floating islands connected by equation bridges.

**2. Who is the main character? What kind of person/creature is the protagonist? What makes them special or interesting?** (A brave knight, curious child, alien explorer, detective, wizard apprentice, etc.)
- Answer: Charlie, a baby dragon who starts small and grows throughout the story. Charlie is curious, brave, and good at solving puzzles. What makes Charlie special is that he gets to choose what type of dragon to become during the adventure - each choice shapes his abilities and how he approaches challenges.

**3. What's the main goal or problem? What does the main character need to accomplish or solve?** (Rescue someone, find a treasure, solve a mystery, save the world, make friends, etc.)
- Answer: Dragon eggs have been stolen from the Kingdom of Mathematica! The dragons are the good guardians of mathematical knowledge, and without the eggs, the kingdom's magical balance is failing. Charlie must find and rescue the stolen eggs before the kingdom loses all its mathematical magic forever.

**4. What obstacles will they face? What challenges, enemies, or difficult situations will make the journey interesting?** (Monsters, puzzles, moral dilemmas, time limits, rival characters, etc.)
- Answer: Mathematical puzzles that must be solved to progress, locked doors requiring special keys, map-reading challenges, temptations to become a bad dragon (which leads to game over), rival creatures who want to corrupt Charlie, and complex mazes where wrong answers lead to dead ends.

**5. What special abilities or tools do they have? What helps the character on their journey?** (Magic powers, special weapons, helpful companions, unique skills, technology, etc.)
- Answer: Charlie's growing dragon abilities that change based on player choices: Fire breathing, mega flying, rock armor, ice powers, magic spells, or even becoming an Ender dragon (good version). Also mathematical intuition, the ability to collect and use keys/objects, and a special map that reveals secrets when mathematical questions are answered correctly.

**6. What are 3-4 key locations in your story? What important places will the character visit?** (Starting point, dangerous area, safe haven, final destination, etc.)
- Answer: 
- Dragon Nursery (starting point) - where Charlie hatches and learns about the theft
- The Great Mathematical Library - filled with puzzle books and ancient formulas
- Crystal Caves of Calculation - dangerous underground maze with numerical riddles
- The Floating Fortress of the Egg Thieves - final destination where the stolen eggs are hidden

**7. What game mechanics do you want? Should it be just choices, or include dice rolling and items?** (Just choices, Dice rolling: Add chance/luck elements (rolling to see if you succeed at risky actions), Items: Collect and use objects (keys to unlock doors, passwords to remember, tools to solve puzzles, etc.) What kinds of puzzles or challenges? (Unlock doors, remember codes from earlier scenes, combine objects, trade with characters, etc.)
- Answer: Items system with mathematical puzzle solving. Players collect keys, magical objects, map pieces, and formula scrolls. Puzzles include: unlocking doors with number combinations, using collected formulas to solve riddles, remembering mathematical sequences from earlier scenes, and combining objects to create new tools. Map-based challenges where players must answer questions about locations to navigate correctly. A few chance based actions too, a least one in each story arc and one towards the beginning that guides the story arcs

**8. What kinds of choices should players make? What types of decisions do you want to be interesting?** (Combat vs. stealth, helping vs. ignoring others, taking risks vs. playing safe, etc.)
- Answer: Choosing what type of dragon to become (affects abilities and story paths), solving problems with math vs. using dragon powers, helping other creatures vs. focusing only on the mission, resisting temptation to become evil vs. taking shortcuts that lead to corruption, and deciding which paths to take through the mathematical kingdom.

**9. How many different endings do you want?** Should there be happy endings, sad endings, funny endings, or surprising twists? How many total endings feel right?**
- Answer: Multiple happy endings based on what type of dragon Charlie becomes (6 different dragon types = 6 different victory endings), plus several "game over" bad endings if Charlie is corrupted and becomes evil. About 8-10 total endings with most being positive but achieved through different dragon paths.

**10. What's the tone of your story?** Should it be funny, scary, adventurous, mysterious, heartwarming, or a mix? What mood do you want players to feel?**
- Answer: Adventurous and educational with heartwarming moments. The tone should be exciting but not scary - more like a fun mathematical adventure. Players should feel curious about solving puzzles, proud when they figure out math problems, and excited about growing stronger as a dragon. Mysterious elements around the egg theft but ultimately optimistic and empowering.

**11. What's your favorite part of the story idea?** What element are you most excited about? This can help you focus on what makes your story unique and fun!**
- Answer: The character growth system where Charlie evolves into different types of dragons based on player choices, combined with the mathematical puzzle-solving that actually teaches math concepts while being fun. The idea that math is magical and powerful, and that learning makes you literally grow stronger as a dragon, is really exciting and unique!

Instructions: Create a story based on this. Ensure that there are about 80 nodes, I will further check if nodes are missing, contain invalid references or orphaned nodes. Please ensure that there is a good balance of nodes throughout the journey, now more than 3-4 choices at any point, generally prefer a linear story lines (or 'pathed' story lines if multiple endings have been suggested)
